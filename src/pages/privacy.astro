      <p>
        Flatiron Kids ("we", "our", or "us") builds mobile applications for children and families.
        Your privacy is important to us. This policy is simple because our data practices are simple.
      </p>

      <h2>We Don't Collect Data</h2>
      <p>
        Our apps do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information or usage data.
        There are no accounts, no analytics, no crash reporting, and no tracking of any kind.
      </p>

      <h2>No Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        Our apps do not use third-party services, SDKs, or data processors.
        No data leaves your device.
      </p>

      <h2>No Advertising</h2>
      <p>Our apps do not contain advertisements of any kind.</p>

      <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Our apps are designed with children in mind. Since we collect no data whatsoever,
        there is no personal information at risk. We comply with COPPA and all applicable
        children's privacy regulations.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        If this policy changes, we will update this page. We don't expect it to — our
        approach to data is to not collect it.
      </p>
