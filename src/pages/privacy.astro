      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="text-gray-500 text-sm !mt-2">Last updated: {lastUpdated}</p>

      <p>
        Flatiron Kids ("we", "our", or "us") builds mobile applications designed for children and families. We take your
        family's privacy seriously — especially when it comes to children. This policy explains what information our apps
        collect (spoiler: as little as possible) and how we handle it.
      </p>

      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        Our apps are designed to work without collecting personal information. We do not require account creation, and we
        do not ask children to provide names, email addresses, photos, or any other personal data.
      </p>
      <p>We may collect limited, non-personal technical data to keep our apps running smoothly, such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Device type and operating system version</li>
        <li>App version</li>
        <li>Crash logs and performance data</li>
        <li>General usage analytics (not tied to any individual)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Children's Privacy (COPPA)</h2>
      <p>
        We comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). We do not knowingly collect personal
        information from children under 13. Our apps do not include features that allow children to share personal
        information publicly or with third parties.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you believe we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child, please contact us immediately
        and we will delete it.
      </p>

      <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        Our apps may use the following third-party services that could collect limited, anonymous data:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Apple App Store / Google Play Store</strong> — for app distribution and updates</li>
        <li><strong>Crash reporting services</strong> — to identify and fix bugs</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These services have their own privacy policies. We do not use third-party advertising networks in our apps.
      </p>

      <h2>Advertising</h2>
      <p>Our apps do not contain advertisements of any kind.</p>

      <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
      <p>
        If an app offers in-app purchases, they are always gated behind a parental verification mechanism. Children
        cannot make purchases without a parent or guardian's involvement.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
      <p>
        We do not sell, trade, or share personal information with third parties. The limited technical data we collect is
        used solely to improve app performance and stability.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        Since we do not collect personal information, there is no personal data to retain. Anonymous crash and analytics
        data is retained only as long as needed for debugging and product improvement.
      </p>

      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>
        We implement reasonable security measures to protect the limited data we process. However, no method of
        electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated "last
        updated" date. We encourage you to review this page periodically.
      </p>
